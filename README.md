    <h1>What is WHS UNICEF?</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/" target="_blank">WHS UNICEF</a> is a club that resides in Gretchen Whitney High School located in California. They strive to become the voice of UNICEF and UNICEF USA for the teen/student target audience and further advocate for the global mission statement - "for every child". A new theme or humanitarian issue is decided on every month to base service activities and newsletters around it. </p>
    <h2>Current Service Activities</h2>

    <p>Theme of the Month: Education</p>
    <p>There is a School Supply Drive that is taking place from Tuesday, September 24th to Friday, September 27th. All donations will be donated to a title I elementary school in LA County; Title I schools are schools that consist of students who typically come from low-income families and lack necessities. With that in mind, all donated supplies must be new and donations will be available in the quad during lunch. Every <strong>two supplies </strong> will equal <strong>0.5 hours</strong>, with a <strong>max of 2 hours</strong>. </p>
