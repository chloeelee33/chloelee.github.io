    <h1>What is WHS UNICEF?</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/" target="_blank">WHS UNICEF</a> is a club that resides in Gretchen Whitney High School located in California. They strive to become the voice of UNICEF and UNICEF USA for the teen/student target audience and further advocate for the global mission statement - "for every child". A new theme or humanitarian issue is decided on every month to base service activities and newsletters around it. </p>
    <h2>Past and Current Service Activities</h2>

    <p>If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you’re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>
